# 2048 Game

## Introduction
The **2048 Game** is a single-player puzzle game played on a grid of squares, where the objective is to combine numbered tiles to reach the coveted tile with the value of 2048. Players can slide tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right) to merge tiles of the same value, creating larger tiles and earning points in the process. This project implements the rules and mechanics of the 2048 game, allowing for an interactive and engaging experience.

## Features
